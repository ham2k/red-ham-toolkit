# lib-callsigns

A JavaScript library for parsing Amateur Radio callsigns.

# Callsign structure

The best source of information is the [Wikipedia Article on Amateur radio call signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_call_signs)

## Basic rules

- An amateur operator's call sign is composed of a prefix, a separating numeral and a suffix.

- Call signs begin with a one- two- or three-character prefix chosen from a range assigned by the ITU to the amateur's country of operation

- Single letter prefixes: B (China), F (France), G (United Kingdom), I (Italy), K (USA), M (UK), N (USA), R (Russia) or W (USA)

- The jurisdiction then assigns a single digit (a numeral to separate prefix from suffix) as well as a suffix of from one to four characters (the last being a letter).

## Exceptions

### Callsigns with no separating numeral
- Sometimes countries issue a special event callsign using a prefix that includes a number, without any extra separating numeral.
For example, Bahamas has assigned the C6A-C6Z block. The prefix for "C6AFO" would be "C6", with no number.
Other examples, D9K for Korea, H2T for Cyprus, S9Z for Sao Tome, or 4U for the United Nations.

- Panama allows the use of "HP/" as a prefix when operating from a cruise ship registered in Panama, so again, a prefix without a numeral.

- Fiji and Swaziland are assigned 3DN–3DZ and 3DA–3DM respectively, so they should choose also the third character from the left to produce unique call signs, but in practise do not. Fiji has issued many call signs with a '3D' prefix and a '2' numeral separator. In theory this does not distinguish their call signs from Swaziland which is issued the 3DA–3DM block.

- Niger seems to have issued callsigns with no separator, like Bahamas or Korea, but unlike those other countries, their prefix has the number first instead of last. For example [5UAIHM](https://www.qrz.com/db/5UAIHM).

### Special Event callsigns

- Often have suffixes with more than four characters.

- There are special call signs that have no final letter. Country Files show AX2000 for Australia, for example, Wikipedia page mentions XE21 and VX7150

- Special callsigns celebrating King of Spain EF6, and King of Jordan, JY1, have no suffix.

## Modifiers

- CEPT signatory countries allow for licensed amateurs from one country to operate in another, and it requires the prefix of the country being visited to be added as premodifier. So `YV/N0CALL` is `N0CALL` operating from `YV`.

- Canada and Peru require the prefix of the area the operator is operating from to be included as a postmodifier. The US used to, and while it is no longer required, it is still common to use it.

- When a country's separating numeral denotes a geographic area within, an operator from one region operating in another region can affix a secondary suffix indicating so. For instance an amateur from Queensland, Australia, operating in Tasmania can sign as VK4xxx/7 or VK4xxx/VK7.

- Argentina uses the first letter of the suffix as a regional designator. And it allows a postmodifier letter to replace it. So `LU1NABC` is located in Santiago del Estero, and `LU5AXYZ` is located in Buenos Aires, but `LU5AXYZ/N` is operating from Santiago del Estero.

# CQ WPX

CQ Magazine has both contests and [awards](https://cq-amateur-radio.com/cq_awards/cq_wpx_awards/cq-wpx-award-rules-022017.pdf) that are based on callsign prefixes.

Their prefix rules are slightly different from ITU's. They include all separating numerals as part of the prefix, not just the first one.

And when a prefix is defined by a modifier but does not include a numeral, it defaults to 0.
